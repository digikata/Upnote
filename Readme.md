Upnote
======

Upnote is a toy clone of [Notational Velocity][1] a note taking program.
Both Notational Velocity or [nvALT][2], a fork of the original NV, run only
on OS X. Upnote uses Qt C++ (c++11) to hopefully be cross platform.

Upnote development can be found at https://github.com/digikata/Upnote

Upnote lacks many features that nv and nvAlt, but you can use it with a
directory of text files. Right now it can load and search a set of text
files in a test directory. It's still very early it's development, so I
wouldn't trust any critical files to Upnote at this point.

Upnote is open source. See the LICENSE file that applies to the source
code of this software.

You'll need a Qt dev environment, qmake and optionally Qt creator to build
Upnote. [Qt 5][3] is recommended.
