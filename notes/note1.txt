The Norman Cob is a breed of light draft horse that originated in Normandy in northern France. It has a range of heights and weights due to selective breeding for a wide range of uses and is known for its lively, long-striding trot. Colors accepted by the breed registry include chestnut, bay and seal brown. Norman Cobs are popular for recreational and competitive driving, and are also used for several riding disciplines. In its homeland, the Norman Cob was originally used widely for agriculture, but the advent of mechanization threatened all French draft breeds, and many breeders turned their production towards the meat market. Norman Cob breeders instead crossed their horses with Thoroughbreds to contribute to the Selle Fran√ßais breed, now France's national saddle horse. This allowed the Norman Cob to remain a light draft horse through the decades, while other draft breeds were growing heavier and slower due to selection for meat. Genetic studies in the 1980s showed the breed suffered from inbreeding and genetic drift. Breed enthusiasts worked to develop new selection criteria for breeding stock, and population numbers are now relatively stable.
